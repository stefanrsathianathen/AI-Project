PROJECT PLAN


We plan to implement a min-max algorithm at first so if our idea does not work
or worse fails, we have something we can turn in.

After implementing a min-max algorithm we plan on developing our own algorithm
implementing of the Alpha-go approach that google took. We believe that this will
take a decent amount of time and will require outside research to complete.
Therefore, if we believe that we can not fully implement it we will resort to an
algorithm that learns from its previous moves.

We plan to meet at least once every week and discuss how to proceed and also how
much we should finish until our next meeting. We'll write most of the codes during
our meetings and divide the extra research work amongst us which is required to
write the codes successfully. Other than that, we'll be in touch through social
media if it is required.

Since we are both doing Software Modelling and Design(SWEN30006) along with this
subject, we have an assignment due by the 11th of May for that subject.
